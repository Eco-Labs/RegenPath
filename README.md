RegenPath
Empowering Regenerative Land Stewards
RegenPath is a digital platform designed to onboard millions of environmental stewards, or “Regenerators,” into the world of Regenerative Finance (ReFi) and Web3. By leveraging innovative technologies like a vector-based matchmaking engine, decentralized identifiers (DIDs), and issuing Bioregional Passports (a form of verifiable credentials), we aim to help anyone find their pathway to earning a regenerative income.

🌱 Project Overview
RegenPath is built to connect individuals with regenerative projects that provide income opportunities for positive ecological impact. Our platform features a guided onboarding questionnaire that gathers key details about each user's skills, location, resources, and goals. We then use this context to match them with pathways where they can get paid to make a difference.

Core Features:
AI-Powered Matchmaking: Uses vector-based similarity search to match users with pathways suited to their context, skills, and available resources.
Bioregional Passports: Verifiable credentials that acknowledge the skills, reputation, and contributions of Regenerators across various bioregions.
Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs): Empower users with secure, self-sovereign digital identities for eco-project participation.
🚀 Tech Stack
Front-end: Built using Bubble, a no-code platform that facilitates fast prototyping and user experience design.
Database: Pinecone for storing and querying vector-based embeddings for advanced filtering and matchmaking.
AI Integration: OpenAI API for generating embeddings based on user responses and project descriptions.
🎯 Goals & Use Cases
Current Focus: The initial version of RegenPath focuses on the core functionality of pathfinding — matching Regenerators with existing projects and systems that compensate positive action. Our database includes pathways from reputable projects, enabling anyone to earn through regenerative activities.

Future Plans:
With the matchmaking engine and database in place, our next development goals include:

Multi-Chain Wallet Creation & Abstraction: Simplifying interactions across different blockchain networks.
Bioregional Passport Feature: Recognizing and verifying skills, reputation, and contributions using secure, decentralized identifiers.
Use Cases for Bioregional Passports:
Reputation Sensing: Identifying disconnects between Regenerators and their communities.
Tracking Eco Assets: Facilitating the integration and monitoring of ecological assets within the platform.
Empowering Volunteers: Issuing peer-to-peer badges to acknowledge skills and contributions.
Consultant Impact Tracking: Recording the impact of Regen experts on various projects over time.
Engaging Patrons: Rewarding eco-tourism participants and contributors with recognition for funding milestones.

📚 How to Get Started
We’ve provided basic scripts and datasets that showcase the core functionality of RegenPath. To get started:

Clone the repository.
Check out the embedding-scripts/ folder for Python scripts that interact with OpenAI and Pinecone.
Explore the example-datasets/ folder to see how we structure and query regenerative pathways.
🌐 Open-Source Vision
RegenPath is committed to open-source principles. As our project evolves, we plan to:

Release portions of the source code for custom scripts and AI prompts.
Open-source the data models and matching algorithms used in our backend.
Invite contributions from developers, regenerative finance enthusiasts, and community members to expand the platform’s functionality.
🛠️ Future Development
In the coming months, we aim to:

Expand the pathway database with more user-generated and verified regenerative projects.
Develop multi-chain wallet features and Bioregional Passports for verified credentials.
Enhance the AI model for more context-aware and precise recommendations.
